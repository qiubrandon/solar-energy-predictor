# Solar Energy Predictor

Welcome to the **Solar Energy Predictor** project! Its not very flashy nor does it work super well, but it can be helpful for solar farmers, if they want to predict solar irradiance (GHI). ðŸš€

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Download Solar Data**
To train the model, you'll need to obtain a solar dataset from the **NREL Solar Data repository**. Save this file in your project directory.

### **2. Create a `config.py` File**
In the root directory, create a `config.py` file to store the following configuration variables:

```
PATH = ""         # Path to your solar data CSV file
KEY = ""          # API key for WeatherAPI
URL = ""          # URL endpoint for WeatherAPI
MODEL_PATH = ""   # Path to save or load the trained model
```
### **3. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **4. Run Tests**
Before diving in, test the setup to ensure the code is functioning as expected:
```bash
pytest
```
Note: Test should pass, that means that the model is trained. Please check your weather api/data/dataset otherwise.

### **5. Start the Server**
To start the FastAPI server and access the prediction API:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to use the web interface.
```

### **6. Use the Trained Model**
If you already have a trained model, you can use it to make predictions. Place your model in the path specified in MODEL_PATH, and the server will load it for inference.

### **Known Issues**
Some features may not work as expected.
Testing is incomplete, and certain edge cases might not be handled.
The modelâ€™s performance depends on the quality of the dataset and preprocessing.
If you encounter problems, feel free to explore and tweak the codeâ€”itâ€™s a great opportunity to contribute!
